# Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Analysis


index : The unique ID of each observation.

class : The true class of each observation. The classes are binary (0 or 1).

predicted_prob : The model's estimate of probability that the observation belongs to class 1.



## Manually calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the model, using a predicted_prob threshold of greater than or equal to .5.
